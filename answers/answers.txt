1.  $ mkdir answers
2.  $ > answers/answers.txt
3.  $ vim answers/answers.txt
4.  $ pwd
    /Users/evankeleti/Github/assignment-1
5.  The flag -a will make ls list hidden files.    
6.  To list files outside of the current directory, use 'ls [file]', where the [file] argument is either a file to be listed or a directory that contains the files to be listed.
7.  rm is a dangerous command because unless the interactive option -i is specified, it will permanently delete files without asking for confirmation. For example, if rm was used on a 
    directory with the recursive option -r, and -i was omitted, then rm would permanently delete the directory and all its contents. If the directory or one of its subdirectories contained
    an important file that was unnoticed, it would be lost forever unless a backup existed somewhere.
8.  $ mkdir answers/results
9.  $ vim answers/results/my_script.sh
10. $ chmod 755 answers/results/my_script.sh
11. I never left the assignment-1 directory but if I was in answers I would do:
    $ cd ../assignment-1-main-main/data
12. $ wc -w * | sort -nr | head -n 3 | tail -n 1
13. $ for csv in *.csv; do ../../answers/results/my_script.sh $csv ; done
14. $ mkdir unzipped-files; unzip -d unzipped-files/ '*.zip'
15. $ rm *.zip
16. $ cp unzipped-files/*_2* ../../answers/results/
