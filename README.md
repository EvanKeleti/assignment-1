Evan Keleti

I am a first year at Brandeis and a computer science major. I chose to take this course because my father is very involved in environmental work, and I've talked with him a bit about the 
role of data analysis and other aspects of computer science in the field of environmental science. At the moment, I know my future career will definitely involve computer science 
in some way, but I am unsure about what I want to pursue specifically because I am also intersted in many other fields. When I have free time, I mostly enjoy reading, although I've 
recently begun learning how to create games with Unity.
